# big_brother_cv

Big Brother CV is a system that enables remote monitoring of your house in order to ensure that your young ones do not find themselves in possible dangerous situations.
The systme is built using OpenCV, and is capable of recognizing a set amount of situations that may occur in the user's house, such as a person holding a knife,
a youngster standing near a hot object, holding certain unhealthy foods and many more.
The system is operatable through an app created with Android Studio, and can be controlled from anywhere, as the app and core algorithm communicate through Firebase and work
simultaneously.

The app offers recent updates about events caught by the camera, alerts when a possible dangerous situation occurs, the ability to choose which events are more important for
you to monitor, and a detailed report about the events that occured while using the system.
